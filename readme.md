## Public Bierdopje API

[Bierdopje](http://www.bierdopje.com) is a dutch community where series are discussed.

To use the API you need an API key, but it appears no keys are being handed out any more.
This project is aimed at those that still want to experiment with the API of Bierdopje but can't get their hands on a key.

Point your requests to `https://bierdopje-api.houtevelts.com` and we'll provide you with what Bierdopje answers.
